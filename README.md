# Budget
The system my wife and I currently use for our budget is part manual, part electronic. I have a spreadsheet with our monthly budget that I then print out for her. She uses the sheets to keep track of our actual spending throughout the month. I then take the completed sheets at the end of the month and reconcile everything for the next month.

This project is intended to replace the electronic part of the process but not the manual. My wife does much better with paper sheets in her hands rather than having an app to update. This is why sites like Mint or You Need A Budget donâ€™t really work for us.

With that in mind, here are the features I want in this app:

- Allow me to indicate the income for the month
- Allow me to create expense categories
- Expenses will have a name, frequency, amount, and potentially a due date
- Expenses with a frequency longer than a month (quarterly, yearly, etc.) will be broken down monthly
- Expenses with a frequency longer than a month will accumulate a balance
- Expenses whose due date is shorter than the frequency will be broken up correctly. Example: A new yearly category is added but the next payment is actually due in 8 months. The monthly expense will be Amount / 8 until the due date, where it will change to Amount / 12.
- Show me a running total of how much I have left
- Print the sheets
- Allow me to reconcile the month by entering how much was spent in each category that month
- Allow me to shift money from one category to another to cover overages
